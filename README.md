# 🚲 Bike Rental Demand Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the daily demand for bike rentals based on time, weather, and environmental features using machine learning regression models.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Bike-sharing systems are gaining popularity in urban areas. Predicting the demand accurately can help optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve user experience.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn** (Linear Regression, Model Evaluation)

## 📈 Key Features
- Performed extensive **EDA** (exploratory data analysis) to understand patterns and correlations.
- Applied **feature engineering** and **data preprocessing** (encoding, scaling).
- Built a **Linear Regression model** to predict daily rental counts.
- Evaluated using **R² score** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**.

## 🧠 Results
- Identified key predictors: temperature, humidity, working day, and season.
- Achieved a strong R² score indicating good model performance.
